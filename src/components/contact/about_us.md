## About our holiday home

Thank you for choosing our home for your stay! We discovered Xlendi as young newlyweds and fell so in love with the area that we bought this apartment as our holiday escape.

Now, with our two young daughters, it has become our cherished family getaway. We love spending our days at the beach and exploring the beautiful hiking trails around the island. We hope you find it as relaxing and enjoyable as we do!

We're available to answer any questions you may have during your stay and want to make it as comfortable as possible. The best way to reach us is by text or email.

Thank you again, and we look forward to welcoming you to Gozo!

All the best,

_Rebecca & Daniel_
